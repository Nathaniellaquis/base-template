## 🔧 What You Need to Do (30 minutes total)

### 1. **Add Price IDs to .env** (5 minutes) 🔴 CRITICAL

Add these to your `.env` file RIGHT NOW:

```bash
# Copy and paste these exact values:
STRIPE_PRICE_BASIC_MONTHLY=price_1Rzx7j7rbDTO2oot3FQGOnPL
STRIPE_PRICE_BASIC_YEARLY=price_1Rzx7p7rbDTO2ootlo3WyNta
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY=price_1Rzx807rbDTO2ootuQYsRigD
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEARLY=price_1Rzx867rbDTO2oot2OL5E9x0
STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY=price_1Rzx8I7rbDTO2ootwC71xMou
STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_YEARLY=price_1Rzx8N7rbDTO2ootjDTTxVAn
```

**Without these, payments will fail!**

### 2. **Configure Apple Pay** (20 minutes) 🍎

Follow the guide in `apple-pay-setup-guide.md`:
1. Go to Apple Developer Portal
2. Create Payment Processing Certificate
3. Upload to Stripe Dashboard
4. Verify your domain

**Note:** Google Pay works immediately - no setup needed!

### 3. **Test the Flow** (5 minutes) 📱

```bash
# Start your backend
cd server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, start the app
cd app
npx expo run:ios --device  # Must use physical device for Apple Pay
```

Test this flow:
1. Start onboarding
2. Reach plan selection screen
3. Select Pro plan
4. Toggle between Monthly/Yearly
5. Tap Continue
6. See payment modal with Apple Pay button
7. Complete test payment

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Invalid price ID" error
**Solution:** You forgot to add price IDs to `.env`. See step 1 above.

### Issue 2: Apple Pay button not showing
**Solutions:**
- Must test on physical iOS device (not simulator)
- Need Apple Pay certificate configured
- Check if test card is in Wallet app

### Issue 3: Payment fails with "No such price"
**Solution:** Restart your backend after adding environment variables

### Issue 4: "Platform pay not supported"
**Solutions:**
- For iOS: Test on physical device with iOS 12+
- For Android: Ensure Google Pay is installed
- Check device has payment cards added

## 📊 What Success Looks Like
