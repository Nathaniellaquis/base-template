I've successfully created all your subscription products and prices in your Stripe account. Here are the IDs you need to update in your environment variables:

## üìù Environment Variables to Update

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# ===============================================
# STRIPE PRICE IDs - CREATED ON 2025-01-24

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Update your `.env` file** with the price IDs above
2. **Restart your backend server** to load the new environment variables
3. **Test a subscription** to ensure everything is connected properly

## üß™ Testing

You can now test subscriptions! Since these are live mode prices, you'll need to:
1. Use Stripe test cards (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242)
2. Or switch to test mode in Stripe Dashboard and create test prices

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- These prices are created in **LIVE MODE** (based on your Stripe account status)
- The 14-day trial is configured in your code, not on the prices
- Prices are in USD cents (999 = $9.99)

## üîó View in Stripe Dashboard

You can view and manage these products at:
https://dashboard.stripe.com/products

Each product has both monthly and yearly pricing configured and ready to use!
