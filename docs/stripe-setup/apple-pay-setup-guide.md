    <string>merchant.com.ingrd</string>
</array>
```

```javascript
"merchantIdentifier": "merchant.com.ingrd"
```

‚úÖ **Environment Variable**:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_MERCHANT_ID=merchant.com.ingrd
```

## Step 7: Testing Apple Pay

### Test Cards for Sandbox

Use these test cards in Stripe TEST mode:
- `4242 4242 4242 4242` - Visa (any CVC, any future date)
- `5555 5555 5555 4444` - Mastercard
- `3782 822463 10005` - Amex

### Testing on Device

1. **Add Test Card to Wallet**
   - Open Wallet app on test device
   - Add a test card (use Stripe test cards)
   
2. **Enable Sandbox Testing**
   - Settings ‚Üí Wallet & Apple Pay ‚Üí Enable "Sandbox Testing"

3. **Run Your App**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

4. **Test Payment Flow**
   - Open your app
   - Go to subscription/payment screen
   - Apple Pay button should appear
   - Tap to initiate payment
   - Authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID

## Troubleshooting

### Apple Pay Button Not Showing

1. **Check Device Support**
   ```typescript
   // Add debug logging in useNativePayment.ts
   const checkSupport = async () => {
     const supported = await isPlatformPaySupported();
     console.log('Apple Pay supported:', supported);
     console.log('Platform:', Platform.OS);
     console.log('Device:', DeviceInfo.getModel());
   };
   ```

2. **Verify Merchant ID**
   - Ensure merchant ID matches everywhere:
     - Apple Developer Portal
     - Stripe Dashboard
     - App entitlements
     - Environment variables

3. **Check Stripe Initialization**
   ```typescript
   // In PaymentProvider
   console.log('Stripe config:', {
     publishableKey: config.stripe.publishableKey,
     merchantId: config.stripe.merchantId,
   });
   ```

### Payment Fails

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for Stripe error codes
   - Common issues:
     - `merchant_id_mismatch`: Merchant IDs don't match
     - `invalid_certificate`: Certificate not properly uploaded
     - `domain_not_verified`: For web payments

2. **Verify Backend**
   - Ensure price IDs are correct in `.env`
   - Check webhook is receiving events
   - Verify customer creation succeeds
