# Payment Implementation Technical Roadmap

## Overview
Complete the payment implementation to enable web payments and improve the overall payment experience. The mobile implementation is complete and working - we need to mirror that success on web.

## Current State
- ✅ **Mobile payments**: Fully functional with Stripe React Native
- ❌ **Web payments**: Scaffolding exists but disabled
- ✅ **Backend**: All endpoints and webhooks configured
- ✅ **Subscription management**: Working for existing customers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enable Web Payments (2 hours)
**Goal**: Remove "coming soon" and enable web payment collection

1. **Update PaymentForm.web.tsx**
   - Remove placeholder View showing "coming soon"
   - Enable CardElement with proper styling
   - Mirror mobile's payment confirmation flow

2. **Fix useStripeWeb Hook**
   - Ensure proper initialization
   - Add null checks for stripe/elements
   - Return consistent interface with mobile

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Add EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to .env.example
   - Document required Stripe configuration

### Phase 2: Code Consolidation (1 hour)
**Goal**: DRY up payment code and improve maintainability

1. **Extract Common Logic**
   - Create shared payment utilities
   - Consolidate error handling
   - Unify success callbacks

2. **Simplify Platform Files**
   - Move shared logic to base hooks
   - Keep only platform-specific code in .web/.native files
   - Reduce code duplication

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish (1 hour)
**Goal**: Ensure reliability and good UX

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Handle edge cases (network issues, declines)

2. **Loading States**
   - Add loading indicators during payment
   - Disable form during submission
   - Show success confirmation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Web users can enter card details
- [ ] Web payments process successfully
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Code is DRY and maintainable
- [ ] Types are properly defined

## Implementation Notes
- Follow existing patterns from mobile implementation
- Use Stripe test cards: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Don't over-engineer - simple is better
